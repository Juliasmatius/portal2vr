5. Save and relaunch the game.

# I am too tall/my head is in the ceiling!
Press the left thumbstick.

# The FPS is low/I can't hear anything!
Make sure to focus the game's window (click it last).

# The game launches, but I don't see in VR!
If you're using an Oculus headset with the Oculus app, go to Settings -> General -> Enable "Unknown Sources"


# How do I stream/record gameplay?
There are two options: \
In the config, set RenderWindow to 1. (impacts performance) \
Enable "Display VR View" in SteamVR (doesn't allow for audio capture in programs like Discord)

# How do I play co-op?
To play co-op the person in VR needs to have the [latest preview](https://github.com/Gistix/portal2vr/releases).  \
The person in VR needs to be host.

# My portal gun is far away!
In the config file, edit the following:
```
ViewmodelPosCustomOffsetX
ViewmodelPosCustomOffsetY
ViewmodelPosCustomOffsetZ
```
